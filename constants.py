I saw that my left eye was twitching.

- Somewhere we felt that Dr. PS Das was avoiding the actual problem and diverting the treatment to another direction.
- The facial exercises that were suggested could only be done if and only if the face is not going through the spasm but slowly my condition has become such that even while blinking the spasm was occuring as seen below.

- If I start medicines for epilepsy, I will have two more complications:
    - Suffer from drowsiness during daytime. This is a big problem to my profession which requires having good attention especially during daytime.

"""
key_takeaways = """As I ponder upon the takeaways from my journey against this disease, I would like to jot them down for the readers to be aware of certain things that may help them get the right diagnosis:\n
- I had a bias against going for neuro-surgery which caused diversion in the treatment at one point. We shouldn't possess any bias against any kind of surgery if its the only permanent solution to the problem that we as patients are facing. Talk to the consultant surgeon freely, talk about your fears, constraints and doubts. They are there to help you out. Trust them.
- If at any point of time you feel that the consultant's words and way of treatment seems that he/she is not eager to take up your problem seriously change the consultant immediately. Its highly probable that they are going to divert away from actual root cause of the treatment.
- Stay strong, take prescribed medications especially after discharge for quick recovery. Don't rely on your superficial knowledge on medicines during this time.

Below I share the two videos, first one is taken before the surgery, the second one on 8 days after the surgery.
